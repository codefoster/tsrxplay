# tsrxplay
I'm playing a bit with Angular 2 and that implies playing more with both ReactiveX (RxJS) and TypeScript.

#Getting Started
This project uses gulp to transpile the typescript. The build folder is in the .gitignore, so run this to do the transpile and turn src/index.ts file into build/index.js...
```
npm gulp build
```
Then you simply run it by changing into the build folder and using...
```
node .
```
